# Jas Liu (劉傑思)

Hi, I'm Jas Liu! (Pronounced “jase”, rhymes with chase).

I’m a software engineer at [Morning Consult](https://morningconsult.com/), working on data analytics tools and applications.

Previously, I worked at an early-stage startup developing integrated automation solutions for biologists, where I led front-end engineering for their lab inventory management system. Before that, I was a junior policy associate at the [University of Chicago Energy & Environment Lab](https://urbanlabs.uchicago.edu/labs/energy-environment), where I developed predictive analytics models and data engineering processes for environmental policy research with the U.S. EPA, California Air Resources Board, and other agency partners.
