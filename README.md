# Jas Liu (劉傑思)

Hi, I'm Jas Liu! (Pronounced “jase”, rhymes with chase). My pronouns are [they/them](//my.pronoun.is/they).

I'm a Software Engineer at [Radix Labs](//radix.bio), where we build integrated automation solutions for biology labs. I currently lead front-end development for our Rainbow lab database and Timberland service controller, as well as general user authentication and navigation.

Previously, I worked at the [University of Chicago Energy & Environment Lab](https://urbanlabs.uchicago.edu/labs/energy-environment), where I developed predictive analytics models and data engineering processes for environmental policy research with the U.S. EPA, California Air Resources Board, and other agency partners.
